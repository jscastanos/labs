# DateTime Challenge

## Task
- Capture a date from the console and calculate how many days ago it was. Then capture a time from the console and calculate how many hours and minutes ago it was (assume less than now and not previous day). 
- **Bonus** For times, allow the user to choose to specify 12- or 24-hour format. For dates, allow the user to specify month/day/year or day/month/year format based upon their choice. Also, donâ€™t assume times are not the previous day.
