# Pill Reminder Challenge

## Task

- Create an app that tells you what pills to take when you click a button. Have it filter the list using linq and display the results to a list. Wire up the Take Pill button and ensure the pills taken get removed from the list. 
- **Bonus** Instead of clicking a button to update the list, have the list automatically update when medicines should be taken. Make sure taken medications are still removed from the list.

## Note

- I Ported the StarterCode Project from .Net Framework to .Net Core 3.0.
- As of this date, you can't view the new [.Net Core WinForms Designer](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/842375/windows-forms-designer-net-core-is-not-showing-aft.html). Hopefully, Microsoft will fixed it.
