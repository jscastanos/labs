## Author's Notes 
- For this one, I went on a different path since I can't download the [Starter Code](https://iamtimcorey.com/courses/c-weekly-challenges/lectures/6877618) that was provided. So I created the project from scratch and took a different approach on completing the challenge.
- I used CSV Helper library for reading and writing CSV, which also solves the problem given on the bonus task. CSV Helper has a function of mapping properties to position the data the way you want it to be.
